                Instruction to make Recipe
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>Take any jamun mix. Transfer to a sieve and sieve it well. If there are lumps, press
                    with your fingers and sieve it.</li>
                <li>Then measure and take it in a mixing bowl. Add water little by little. I used little less than 1/4
                    cup
                    water. You can replace water with milk too.</li>
                <li>It should just get together to form a sticky mass. Do not knead just use your finger tips for
                    mixing. Do
                    not panic seeing the sticky dough, if the dough is stiff your jamuns will become dry and start to
                    break
                    while frying. Keep the dough aside for 15 mins.</li>
                <li>Take sugar in a pan, add water to it.</li>
                <li>Let it boil, add saffron. Mix it for the sugar to dissolve quickly.</li>
                <li>Boil the syrup until it forms a thick syrup no consistency check needed but the syrup will look more
                    like oil in consistency. It will be glossy just like oil.</li>
                <li>Add rose essence and set aside to cool. Now after 15 mins take the dough.</li>
                <li>Grease your palm with ghee, pinch the dough and roll into a small smooth ball without any cracks. Do
                    not
                    give pressure while rolling.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a kadai - the oil should not be smoking hot. Pinch a tiny piece of dough and add it to
                    oil,
                    it should rise to top slowly that is the right temperature. If the dough rises immediately lower the
                    flame. So keep in low medium flame through out the process and keep adjusting the flame.</li>
                <li>Add few balls , While frying do not touch the balls just swirl the oil using a ladle /spoon this way
                    the
                    jamuns will get evenly fried. The jamun grows bigger while frying.</li>
                <li>Keep swirling the oil and fry until golden brown in low medium flame.</li>
                <li>Remove and drain in tissue paper. Leave in tissue paper for 2 mins. Once the jamuns and the syrup is
                    warm add the jamuns to sugar syrup.</li>
                <li>Let it soak at least for 2 hours before you serve. After that if you want you can refrigerate it.
                </li>
                <li>Gulab Jamun warm or chilled.</li>
