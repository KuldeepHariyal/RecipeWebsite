            <ol>
                <h2>Marinate the chicken</h2>
                <li>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your
                    hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</li>
                <h2>Soak cashews and almonds</h2>
                <li>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the
                    rest of the recipe.</li>
                <h2>Cook the chicken</h2>
                <li>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on
                    each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do
                    not crowd the pan.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.</li>
                <h2>Start making the sauce</h2>
                <li>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat.
                    As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is
                    cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.</li>
                <li>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3
                    minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>
                <h2>Puree the sauce with the nuts</h2>
                <li>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked, drained cashews and
                    almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</li>
                <h2>Finish the dish</h2>
                <li>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a
                    smooth sauce.</li>
                <li>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and
                    simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                <h2>Rest the Butter Chicken</h2>
                <li>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri
                    methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can
                    marry into the butter chicken.</li>
                <h2>Serve</h2>
                <li>Serve the butter chicken with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep
                    refrigerated, covered, for up to 5 days.</li>
