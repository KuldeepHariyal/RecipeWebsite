                Instruction to make Recipe
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>If using store bought paneer, soak in warm water for 20 minutes before you begin the recipe. Also
                    soak frozen green peas in warm water for 10 minutes before using in the recipe.</li>
                <li>To make the paneer soft, soak it in water for some time. Cut the paneer into small cubes and keep it
                    aside. To ensure that the spinach is adulterant-free, soak it in water and add a small pinch of
                    salt. Then clean and wash spinach thoroughly. Now, put a deep-bottomed pan over medium flame and add
                    spinach in it. Cover and cook until the spinach becomes soft and mushy. You need not add any water
                    as spinach gets cooked in its own water. Once cooked, take 100 grams of spinach and chop it well in
                    a bowl. Afterwards, puree the remaining spinach and keep it aside. (Note: You can blanch the spinach
                    as well.)</li>
                <li>Now, put a pan over medium flame and melt ghee in it. Add cumin seeds in it along with halved whole
                    red chilli. Let them temper for a few seconds and then add garlic, onion, green chilli, ginger.
                    Saute well and then add coriander powder, cumin powder, kasoori methi powder and salt. Mix well and
                    cook for 2 minutes. Finally, add cream and pureed spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finally, add cubed paneer in it and gently mix well. Cook for 2 minutes and then add butter in it
                    along with fresh cream, and yellow chilli powder. Cook for another minute and garnish with fresh
                    cream, butter and coriander leaves. Serve hot with Missi Roti or Makki Ki Roti</li>
                <li>Tips:-</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For making Palak Paneer at home, use fresh spinach leaves instead of blanched ones. It has more
                        nutrients than the one which is blanched.</li>
                    <li>To maintain that green colour of your Palak Paneer, make sure you use a little less garam masala
                        powder as it brings a little brown colour to any dish.</li>
                    <li>For a silky smooth flavour in your Palak Paneer, you can add the puree of cashews or almonds
                        (1-2 tsp) while cooking.</li>
                    <li>Try to use Homemade Paneer for this recipe as it would bring a freshness to your dish along with
                        a smooth flavour.</li>
                    <li>Always soak the store-bought paneer for 20-30 minutes in warm water.</li>
                </ul>
